 A blockchain involves a number of nodes/replicas as participants. The replicas are servers in the client-server model. Clients submit transactions/requests to the servers and expect a reply for each request. The transactions may involve certain operations to be executed by the replicas. The replicas deliver the transactions after reaching a consensus on the order of the transactions. Blockchains organize transactions into blocks. Each block has a fixed size and consists of multiple transactions. In some systems, transactions are organized into batches, where each batch consists of a certain number of transactions. In this paper, we use transactions, client requests, and operations interchangeably.
